# Grid Lock
Developed a MATLAB script to address a pick-and-place task using a UR5e robot arm. 

Key contributions include:
1. Computer Vision: Implemented a vision system to detect and classify color-coded game pieces, enhancing the robot's ability to interact with different objects.
2. Perspective Transformation: Applied image processing techniques to convert image coordinates into robot coordinates, ensuring accurate alignment and positioning of the robot arm.
3. Path Planning: Utilized the Bug algorithm to generate an efficient path for the UR5e robot arm, optimizing its movement from the start to the end point and minimizing travel distance.
